A curling house classifier built from the first two lessons of the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course.

The model deployed in the [my_first_deep_learning_notebook](./my_first_deep_learning_notebook.ipynb) is used to classify whether an uploaded image is a curling house or an actual house. 

[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is used to host the notebook and the app can be reached by clicking on the Binder badge above.
